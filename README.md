# React_Posts_App

Used a backend server to fetch the data. Implemented user authentication using JWT token and HTTP request methods - GET, POST, PUT & DELETE for posting, editing and deleting comments.

User is able to:


* Register/create an account
* Login to the app
* Make a new post, delete and modify an existing post
